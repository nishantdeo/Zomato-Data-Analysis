# Zomato Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project aims to analyze customer behavior, restaurant preferences, and market trends using a publicly available Zomato dataset. The analysis provides insights into restaurant types, customer spending, ratings, and order preferences. The data was explored using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques with various Python libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

## Key Objectives
1. **Restaurant Preferences:** Identify the type of restaurants that the majority of customers prefer.
2. **Customer Feedback:** Analyze the number of votes each type of restaurant has received from customers.
3. **Restaurant Ratings:** Determine the common ratings across the majority of restaurants.
4. **Couples' Average Spending:** Calculate the average spending per order by couples, as Zomato observed higher online ordering trends among couples.
5. **Order Mode Preference:** Analyze whether online or offline orders have received higher ratings.
6. **Offline Orders:** Identify which restaurant type receives more offline orders to suggest targeted offers for those customers.

## Methodology
- **Data Cleaning:** Performed comprehensive data cleaning to handle missing values and inconsistent data entries.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Applied EDA techniques to explore and visualize trends, correlations, and patterns in the dataset.
- **Visualization:** Used various chart types such as bar graphs, pie charts, and histograms to represent findings.
- **Python Libraries:**
  - `Pandas` for data manipulation and analysis
  - `NumPy` for numerical computations
  - `Seaborn` and `Matplotlib` for data visualization

## Insights
- **Restaurant Preferences:** Majority of customers prefer certain types of restaurants (e.g., casual dining, cafes).
- **Customer Feedback:** Votes vary significantly by restaurant type, with some types receiving far more customer engagement.
- **Restaurant Ratings:** The majority of restaurants tend to have ratings concentrated in specific ranges.
- **Average Spending:** Couples typically spend an average of X per order when ordering online.
- **Order Mode Preference:** Online orders tend to receive higher ratings compared to offline.
- **Offline Orders:** Specific restaurant types receive a higher percentage of offline orders, making them prime candidates for promotional offers.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a publicly available Zomato dataset, which includes restaurant details such as name, location, type, votes, ratings, and more.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, GitHub

## Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into customer preferences and behavior patterns that can assist Zomato in optimizing its offerings and marketing strategies. By analyzing market trends, the analysis offers actionable recommendations for targeted promotions and customer engagement.
